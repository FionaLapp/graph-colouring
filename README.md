# graph-colouring
Implementation of a Greedy graph colouring and visualisation using tkinter. Simply run the python code, which will open a tkinter window with which the user can interact.

In both versions, the user can create a graph using the "draw vertex", "delete vertex", "draw edge" and "delete edge" button. To reset the canvas, click reset. The graph can then be coloured with a greedy colouring using the "colouring button". 

## Version 1
In version 1, the colouring button simply presents the user with a completed greedy colouring. The colouring has been achieved using the largest degree ordering heuristic.

## Version 2
In version 2, the user can step through the colouring process vertex by vertex, allowing them to gain further understanding of greedy colouring using largest degree ordering

## Nota Bene
I wrote this a while ago when I knew even less about coding ettiquette than I do now, so bon appetit
